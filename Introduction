Expected Outcomes and Significance (Wony)

	It is to be expected that tennis player statistics, to a certain degree, should be able to predict their current and future rankings. In general observation, the majority of the top players will remain near the top of the rankings for the majority of their careers. It will be interesting to see if any predictors can significantly predict which players are to rise or fall in their rankings. It is expected that age, current rankings, and their previous rise in rankings over preceding years. There are also some factors that will be interesting to explore their effect on world rankings, such as physical attributes. 
	Itâ€™ll be interesting to explore whether, and if so, the extent, the future ranking of Tennis players can be forecasted using current statistics. Although there are not any significant real world impacts that any of our findings will lead to, it will be an interesting read for any sports fans and data junkies to read and expand upon. Based on our findings, it will be interesting to explore whether there are any missing factors that could improve on our prediction model; and the result of applying our model to other sports as well.
