    "By using the data set of games won or lost by a tennis player, we are able to use several categorical variables to predict and classify the future ranking of a particular tennis player based on these attributes. This leads to the question, how well do variables relating to player status, age, height, current rank, and playing hand predict the future ranking of the player during later tennis seasons? The dataset used to answer this question will be the game results for the top 500 players during the 2018 tennis season. This particular data was chosen to avoid interruptions by the COVID-19 pandemic, and to ensure that the data would no longer be able to be altered by new data. The dataset includes data from both winners and losers of rounds of national and international tennis tournaments, mostly hosted by the ATP world tour. The rankings will be extracted from ATP’s official website to allow for prediction and comparison. "

Expected Outcomes and Significance (Wony)

	It is to be expected that tennis player statistics, to a certain degree, should be able to predict their current and future rankings. In general observation, the majority of the top players will remain near the top of the rankings for the majority of their careers. It will be interesting to see if any predictors can significantly predict which players are to rise or fall in their rankings. It is expected that age, current rankings, and their previous rise in rankings over preceding years. There are also some factors that will be interesting to explore their effect on world rankings, such as physical attributes. 
	It’ll be interesting to explore whether, and if so, the extent, the future ranking of Tennis players can be forecasted using current statistics. Although there are not any significant real world impacts that any of our findings will lead to, it will be an interesting read for any sports fans and data junkies to read and expand upon. Based on our findings, it will be interesting to explore whether there are any missing factors that could improve on our prediction model; and the result of applying our model to other sports as well.
